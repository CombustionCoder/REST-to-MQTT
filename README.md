# REST-to-MQTT

Author: Jukka Hirvonen

This script forwards received REST events to an online MQTT broker.

Specifically built to forward events from the robotic assembly line
in the Tampere University FASTORY lab.

This is an example demonstration of connecting locally networked 
production assets to a globally available, asynchronous, pub-sub
messaging pattern.

To begin, connect your device in the production line LAN and to the
Internet. Execute the script in Python and follow the prompts to
configure forwarding.
